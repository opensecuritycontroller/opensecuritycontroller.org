# Accessing OSC
After installing the OSC virtual appliance, it can be set up and managed using the [OSC web application](#user-content-accessing-the-osc-web-application) or accessed using the [OSC CLI](#user-content-accessing-osc-through-cli).

## Accessing the OSC Web Application
The OSC web application is used to set up and manage the OSC virtual appliance. It can also be used to configure the OSC virtual appliance for orchestrating a security service.

### Steps to Access the OSC Web Application
1. Open a supported browser, and then enter `https://<IP Address of OSC>` as the URL.
2. In the **Login ID** field, enter the username and corresponding password provided by your OSC administrator.
If you are accessing OSC after the initial setup, use the default username and password: `admin` and `admin123` respectively.
