## Overview

OSC is a centralized platform to enable software-defined security for software-defined datacenters (SDDC). OSC provides a common set of management services, acting as a broker between the security solutions and the virtual infrastructure. You can use OSC to provide services such as nextgeneration IPS and firewall to virtual infrastructures.

### Security Challenges in SDDC
Consider a large-scale SDDC consisting of hundreds of hosts aggregated under multiple clusters. Virtualization provides flexibility and agility to its users, wherein they can spin up virtual machines (VMs). Users can spin up isolated logical networks as easily as one can spin up VMs. All these possibilities require no changes in the physical networking configuration. When multiple users spin up new networks and move working VMs across physical boxes in such a large-scale data center, security is threatened.

### How OSC Secures Virtual Networks
To understand how OSC can orchestrate security for virtual networks, consider a VMware-based SDDC as illustrated here. For the sake of explanation, this SDDC is shown to contain only a few ESXi hosts....

### Advantages of OSC
* OSC facilitates simple, seamless, non-intrusive, and non-disruptive security service integration with an existing virtualized environment.
* The best-in-class security solutions available to your physical networks are available to your virtual networks as a software-based service.
