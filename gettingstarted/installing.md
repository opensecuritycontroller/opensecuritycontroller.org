# Installing the OSC Virtual Appliance

OSC is a virtual appliance installed on a hypervisor. You must use the corresponding virtualization manager to install OSC. In the case of installing on OpenStack, you would use the OpenStack dashboard. In the case of installing on VMware, you would use the vSphere Web Client.

Before you begin, ensure the [OSC requirements](https://github.com/opensecuritycontroller/opensecuritycontroller.org/compare/requirements.md) are met.
