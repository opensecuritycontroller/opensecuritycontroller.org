## Alerts

The **Alerts** tab in OSC displays alerts generated for system, job and appliance instance (DAI) failures. Critical failures can lead to outage in attack detection, in which case the network becomes vulnerable to threats. Alerts are continuously generated for any failure till the problem is resolved. The failure description provided for alerts, eases the process of troubleshooting. Alerts are triggered depending on the alarms configured in the **Alarms** tab.
