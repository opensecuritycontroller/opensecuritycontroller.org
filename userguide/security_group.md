## Define Security Groups

> **Before you Begin**
* To create a security group, you must have already set up a virtualization connector on one of the supported virtualization environments. While you create a security group, you may follow any order to create security groups, deployment specifications, and binding.
* Adding of security group is allowed only in case SDN controller is defined for the virtualization connector.
* It is also advisable to define the manager connector, the service function catalog, and the distributed appliance and deployment specification before you come to this step.
