## Define Traffic Policy Mappings

**Traffic Policy Mappings** exist to provide you a means of enabling you to map a security policy to a **Virtual System**. When you bind a Security Group to a policy in the Security Groups window, this mapping is created automatically. However, you have the option to manually select which policy maps to which **Virtual System**.

To create or modify a deployment specification for a specific distributed appliance, follow these steps.
