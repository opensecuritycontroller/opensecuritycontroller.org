# Troubleshooting OSC Network Issues  

This procedure explains how to troubleshoot failures when [accessing OSC](/gettingstarted/accessing.md) using the OSC CLI or web application. If the OSC IP address is not configured according to the local networking requirements, network issues might occur.  

## Accessing OSC Console  

Access OSC console when troubleshooting network issues. OSC console access in VMware and OpenStack environments are shown below:

### VMware Deployments  

For OSC installed on VMware, access the ESXi host by using the native vSphere desktop application or the vSphere Web Client. 

Right-click on the virtual machine and select **Open Console**.

### OpenStack Deployments  

For OSC installation on OpenStack, go to the **Instances** page on OpenStack Horizon, select the OSC instance to troubleshoot, and then select **Console**.  

## IP Configuration Check 

Enter the credentials at the login screen on the console. After a successful login, use the CLI prompt to check and configure the network using the following IP parameters:  

#### OSC IP Address and Netmask  

Check IP configuration on the OSC management port:   [`show network ip`](/references/cli.md/#user-content-show-network-ip)  

If the expected IP address and netmask are not shown, configure the IP address:  [`set network ip`](/references/cli.md/#user-content-set-network-ip)  

#### Gateway Address  

Check network route to view the default gateway IP address:  [`show network route`](/references/cli.md/#user-content-show-network-route)  

If the expected gateway address is not shown, configure the gateway address: [`set network gateway`](/references/cli.md/#user-content-set-network-gateway)  

#### Test Connection 

After verifying network configurations are correct, ping a remote IP address to test network connectivity by using the command:  
```
$ ping REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS
```
