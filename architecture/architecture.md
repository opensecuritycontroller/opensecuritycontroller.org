# Architecture



This documents describes the high level architecture of OSC highlighting how it interacts with other systems (OpenStack, VMware, SDN controllers, security managers), its plugin and notification models as well how other systems interact with OSC (callback model). This is basically a written version of Manish's presentation.  

Out of Scope: Internal details of OSC like db model, synchronization model (tasks and jobs), UI implementation etc. These material should be part of the community document since it is relevant only for people contributing to OSC code base.
